# Rango

This Django app, named Rango, was meticulously crafted chapter by chapter following the guidance of the "Tango with Django" book. It served as a cornerstone for mastering back-end development within the Django framework. Rango was proudly presented as a component of my Internet Technology module during my university studies.
